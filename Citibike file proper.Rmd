## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
### load libraries for use in current working session
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')

```

```{r import, include=FALSE}
### set your working directory
setwd("/Users/sharathkalappa/Documents/MGT585")

### import data file
# read the files using read.csv
citibike <- read.csv(file = "citibikeDemand.csv",fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')

```

Citi Bike is a private bicycle sharing service in New York City. This is a subsample of the Citi Bike
System Data (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and contains information about demand (the
number of trips) between different stations. The file contains a random sample of taken from June 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018 (31,452 out of 15.7 million rides). The information has been supplemented with
demographic, economic, and weather information pulled from a variety of sources.
We extracted the demographic and economic data from the American Community Survey completed by
the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). Summary data was extracted at
the ZCTA (Zip Code Tabulation Area) level and matched by zip code to each Citi Bike station address.
We extracted the weather data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information historical
weather archive (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). 

Data was collected at the Central Park, NYC weather
station (WBAN Number: 94728) and matched by date and time to Citi Bike trips. The records indicate the
general weather for the NYC area during the ride and are not specific to the weather at any Citi Bike
station.
Citi Bike has two basic user types. A customer buys a temporary pass (a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass). A
subscriber purchases access to bicycles for an entire year. Because subscribers register with Citi Bike,
there is more information about them in the database.


The file contains these following fields:
Customer_prop: The proportion of Customers
DemandDate: the date the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
DemandTime: the time of day (daytime vs evening) the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
DayOfWeek: the day of week the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
Month: the month the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
Demand: the number of trips between the start station and the end station
StartStationId: A unique ID for the station from which the bicycle was rented (the ‘start’ of the trip)
StartStationName: Name (often the street location) of the start station
StartStationLatitude, StartStationLongitude: Latitude and Longitude of the start station
StartNeighborhood: General neighborhood of the start station (e.g., East Harlem, Soho, Park Slope)
Similar fields are defined for the End station (EndStationId, EndStationName, EndStationLatitude,
EndStationLongitude, EndNeighborhood).
For each row (which corresponds to a specific combination of start and end stations), we define
TripDurationMinutes: average duration of trips starting at the start station and ending at the end station,
in minutes
DistanceMiles: Approximate distance between start and end station, for trips starting at the start station
and ending at the end station, in miles. For example, in row two, DistanceMiles= 0.8489, which means
that the approximate distance for trips that started in StartStationId 83 and ended in EndStationId 3368 is
0.8489 miles.
MilesPerHour: Approximate speed of the trip, based on the trip duration and the distance between
stations (we assume – possibly incorrectly – that the trip was direct travel between stations)
StartCommuteTime, EndCommuteTime: The mean travel time in minutes spent commuting to work in
the neighborhoods where the trip started and ended.
Temperature: The temperature (in Fahrenheit) at the Central Park weather observation station at the start
of the trip.
DailySnow: The total snow falls in inches that day at the Central Park weather station.
DailyPrecipitation: Total precipitation in inches that day at the Central Park weather station.
StartPerCapitaIncome, EndPerCapitaIncome: The mean income for each person living in the
neighborhoods where the trip started and ended. It is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of the
residents by the total number of residents in the neighborhood.
StartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle, EndPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: The percentage of households in the
neighborhoods at the start and end of the trip that report not having a vehicle available.

### multiple liner regression

regDemand <-lm(Demand ~ meanTemperature + meanStartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle + meanStartPerCapitaIncome + DemandTime + meanDistanceMiles, data = citibikeOmit)
summary(regDemand)
```

PLEASE DO ANALYSIS. 
talk about coefficients and what they mean, (instead of saying all other variables held constant use "ceteris paribus)
talk about p-values meaning each variable is significant 
talk about r-sq being low so maybe this model isnt that good

```{r other rgeression}
regDemand2 <-lm(Demand ~ meanTemperature + meanStartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle + meanStartPerCapitaIncome + DemandTime + meanDistanceMiles +  meanStartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle:meanStartPerCapitaIncome, data = citibikeOmit)
