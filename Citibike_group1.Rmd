When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Load Packages

In this section, we install and load the necessary packages.

``````{r libraries, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
### Install packages. If you haven't install the dplyr package, please uncomment the line below to install it.
install.packages('dplyr') # required only once.
install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages('lubridate')

### load libraries for use in current working session
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')
library('class') # to run KNN
library('ROSE') # to generate ROC

```

In this section, we import the necessary data for this case study. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
### set your working directory
# use setwd to set your working directory

# you can also go to session-> set working directory -> choose directory
# working directory is the path to the folder and not file

# make sure the path of the directory is correct, i.e., where you have stored your data

# CASE STUDY : CITI BIKE

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike sharing program operating in New York City and it works like Divvy in Chicago.

Mismatch between demand and supply causes imbalanced stations which in turn results in revenue loss (some people may decide to use other services) and high logistic costs (to constantly move the bikes between stations). What citibike does is to rebalance the bikes in each station every night. So, basically there would be trucks that come to the full stations and move some of the bikes to the empty stations.

**The question they face is how many bikes to stock in each station at the beginning of the day?**

*Citi bike hire you as a business analyst to help them answer this question. Apply the 4-step analytics process to solve this problem.*

**Objective: To find the number of bikes to stock in each station at the beginning of the day to maximize the number of daily bike trips.**


# Task:1 Exploring the Dataset

*Citi Bike Data Description*

Citi Bike is a private bicycle sharing service in New York City. This is a subsample of the Citi Bike System Data and contains information about individual bike trips. The data is focused on maintaing a random sample of all trips taken from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018 (31,452 out of 15.7 million rides).\

Citi Bike has two basic user types. A customer buys a temporary pass (a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass). A subscriber purchases access to bicycles for an entire year. Because subscribers register with Citi Bike, there is more information about them in the database. 

**The file contains the following 28 fields:**

*BikeId*: A unique number assigned to each bicycle 
*UserType*: Customer or Subscriber (see above) 
*Age*: Age of the rider. This information is not available for customers. 
*Gender*: male (M), female (F) or unknown (U). All customers are ‘U’. 
*StartDateTime*: the date and time the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
*DayOfWeek*: 1=Sun, 2=Mon, 3=Tues, 4=Wed, 5=Thur, 6=Fri, 7=Sat 
*StartStationId*: A unique ID for the station from which the bicycle was rented (the ‘start’ of the trip) 
*StartStationName*: Name (often the street location) of the start station 
*StartStationLatitude, StartStationLongitude*: Latitude and Longitude of the start station 
*StartNeighborhood*: General neighborhood of the start station (e.g., East Harlem, Soho, Park Slope) 

**Similar fields are defined for the End station (EndStationId, EndStationName, EndStationLatitude, EndStationLongitude, EndNeighborhood).** 

*TripDurationMinutes*: duration of the trip, in minutes 
*DistanceMiles*: Approximate distance between start and end station 
*MilesPerHour*: Approximate speed of the trip, based on the trip duration and the distance between stations (we assume – possibly incorrectly – that the trip was direct travel between stations)
*StartCommuteTime, EndCommuteTime*: The mean travel time in minutes spent commuting to work in the neighborhoods where the trip started and ended. 
*Temperature*: The temperature at the Central Park weather observation station at the start of the trip. 
*DailySnow*: The total snow fall in inches that day at the Central Park weather station. 
*DailyPrecipitation*: Total precipitation in inches that day at the Central Park weather station. 
*StartPerCapitaIncome, EndPerCapitaIncome*: The mean income for each person living in the neighborhoods where the trip started and ended. It is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of the residents by the total number of residents in the neighborhood. 
*StartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle, EndPctHouseholdsNoVehicle*: The percentage of households in the neighborhoods at the start and end of the trip that report not having a vehicle available.

arrange(citibikeDemand, -(Demand))
```

*DemandDate*: Extract it from StartDateTime
*DemandTime*: Categorial variable from StartDateTime: if StartDateTimeis between 12am-11:59am set it to ‘Daytime’, else if StartDateTimeis 12pm-11:59pm set it as ‘Evening’.
*OriginStationId*, *OriginStationName*, *DestinationStationId*, *DestinationStationName*
*Demand*: Number of trips between the start station and end station.
*Customer_prop*, *Subscriber_prop*: Calculate it from UserType.
